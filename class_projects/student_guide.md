### General Notes:
-	Ensure all reported figures are properly formatted and captioned. Focus your efforts on addressing stated objectives and do not be distracted by the extra data available to you in the results reports.

Be sure to provide thoughtful qualitative assessment in addition to reporting the quantitative values.
