# URBANopt SDK Documentation

URBANopt&trade; is an Open-Source Software Development Kit (SDK) for Community and Urban District Energy Modeling 

<img src="doc_files/uo_highlevel.png" alt="graphic showing urbanopt at a high level" />

## Use Cases

The URBANopt project is focused on enabling three primary use cases:

1. Design of low energy campuses and districts through multi-building efficiency scenario analysis 
2.  Design and optimization of grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) at a district-scale in conjunction with distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric distribution systems
3. Detailed design of next-generation district thermal systems

Current capabilities include:

- Commercial and Residential Building modeling analyses
- Grid-Interactivity analyses (via REopt and OpenDSS)
- District Energy Systems design (via DES)
- Optimization (OSAF)
