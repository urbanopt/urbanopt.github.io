# About the URBANopt Project

The URBANopt project is focused on enabling three primary use cases:

- Design of low energy campuses and districts through multi-building efficiency scenario analysis 
- Design and optimization of grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) at a district-scale in conjunction with distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric distribution systems
- Detailed design of next-generation district thermal systems
