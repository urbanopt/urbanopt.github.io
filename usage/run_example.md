The URBANopt example project is a ***<u>hypothetical</u> project only*** that was created
to demonstrate various capabilities of the URBANopt SDK in version 0.1.0 (e.g. modeling
of various building types and heights in one district). An actual location for the
<u>hypothetical</u> project was needed to demonstrate geospatial aspects of the URBANopt SDK.
The <u>hypothetical</u> example project’s location is within the boundary of an actual
district project that is a participant in the U.S. Department of Energy Zero Energy
District Accelerator. See “Western New York Manufacturing Zero Energy District” in [this
NREL paper](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/71841.pdf) for a description of the actual
project. The design in the <u>hypothetical</u> URBANopt example project has no relation
to the designs and site requirements of the actual development project.

The example project design and building typologies are shown in the figure below.

To run URBANopt, move to the top-level directory of the [example project](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-example-geojson-project) you just forked and cloned in the previous step. Run the following commands to set up the Rake tasks defined in the Rakefile of the current working directory.

1. `bundle install` to ensure all dependencies in your [Gemfile](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-example-geojson-project/blob/master/Gemfile) are available
1. `bundle update` to update your gems to the latest available versions
1. `bundle exec rake openstudio:runner:init`  
   This command creates a `runner.conf` file that can be used to configure URBANopt. We
   recommend setting `num_parallel` based on the number of Features you have or cores in
   your CPU. The `Verbose: false` setting prevents excess text from being displayed on your screen while simulations are being run.
1. `bundle exec rake <rake task>` to execute [Rake tasks](rake_tasks.md) as described in the next section.
