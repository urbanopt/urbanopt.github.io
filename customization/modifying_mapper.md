The Simulation Mapper Class maps the Features in the FeatureFile to arguments required as simulation inputs in the OpenStudio workflow files (OSW).

Recall that a Feature refers to a single object in a district energy analysis, such as a
building, district system, or transformer. The FeatureFile includes all data for all
Features and could be written by a third party application or user interface; for our example we use the
GeoJSON format. The input GeoJSON file must be valid and must meet the additional requirements for data supported or required by the appropriate URBANopt GeoJSON Gem [sub-schema](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-geojson-gem/tree/master/lib/urbanopt/geojson/schema). In version 0.1.0, the Simulation Mapper only supports mapping the
[*Building*](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-geojson-gem/blob/master/lib/urbanopt/geojson/building.rb)
feature_type and has the capability to support mapping the following building types from
the
[building_properties](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-geojson-gem/blob/master/lib/urbanopt/geojson/schema/building_properties.json)
schema in the GeoJSON Gem:

- Office
- Outpatient health care
- Inpatient health care
- Lodging
- Food service
- Strip shopping mall
- Retail other than mall
- Education
- Nursing
- Mixed use*

**Note - The Mixed use building type can accommodate up to 4 building types and their
corresponding fractions of total floor area. If the number of building types is fewer than 4,
additional building use types must be added but the fraction of total area can be
entered as 0.*

Within the Mapper Classes, functionality can be added to
apply measures based on the Feature properties. For example, Measures can be implemented
only for a certain building type, or can be implemented only if the number of floors is
greater than a particular number, etc.

The URBANopt GeoJSON Example Project includes a default Simulation Mapper Class to translate an URBANopt GeoJSON Feature to an OpenStudio Model. The `HighEfficiency` mapper class inherits from the `BaselineMapper` class and can override measures that were skipped in the `BaselineMapper`.

When the Scenario is run, a new Simulation Mapper instance is created and the `create_osw` method is implemented for each Feature assigned to the Simulation Mapper Class in the Scenario CSV.

The default Simulation Mapper Class can be used directly, extended, or modified. Alternatively, a completely different Simulation Mapper Class [can be created](new_mapper_class.md).

When adding additional Measures to the OpenStudio workflow file, the Simulation Mapper Class would need to be modified to add any necessary Feature properties from the FeatureFiles and mapping them to new Measure arguments.

The *`OpenStudio::Extension.set_measure_argument`* method sets the Feature property from the FeatureFile as simulation input, passing the Measure and argument name and the corresponding Feature property from the FeatureFile as arguments.

For example:

```ruby
OpenStudio::Extension.set_measure_argument(osw, 'urban_geometry_creation', 'feature_id', feature_id)
```

Where `'urban_geometry_creation'` is the measure name, `'feature_id'` is the argument name and `feature_id` is the Feature property from the FeatureFile.

In case the user wants to use an existing OpenStudio Model of a Feature in the simulation, the name
of the OpenStudio model should be added in the 
`detailed_model_filename` property of the Building Feature in the Feature File. The OpenStudio model should
be added to the detailed_osms folder in the project directory.This OpenStudio model is loaded as a
seed model for the Feature during simulation and measures such as
`create_typical_building_from_model` and `urban_geometry_creation` are skipped for the Feature.

Alternatively, the absolute path of the OpenStudio Model can be added to the `detailed_model_filename` property of the Building Feature in the Feature File.

The user can choose to use OpenStudio Models for some Features and  the `urban_geometry_creation` for
other Features. In this case, Features with OpenStudio Models should include the `id` , `name`, 
`detailed_model_filename` and `number_of_stories` properties in the FeatureFile.

To add custom Measures, or Measures that lie outside of the ruby gems specified in the Gemfile, add the following line (which specifies the file path of the new Measures) to the Mapper Class: `osw[:measure_paths] << File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../new_measure_folder/')`  
This adds the `measure_path` to the OpenStudio workflow file.
