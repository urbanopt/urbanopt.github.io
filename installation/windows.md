# Windows Installation Instructions

As of version 0.3.1, an URBANopt<sup>&trade;</sup> installer (64-bit Windows 7 â€“ 10) is available to install the URBANopt CLI, Ruby, and OpenStudio SDK at the same time.  If you'd rather install the dependencies manually, view the [manual install](#manual-install) section below.

For CLI usage examples, see our [Getting Started page](../getting_started/getting_started.md)

We also have [tutorial videos](../resources/tutorials/tutorials.md) available to guide you through the installation steps.

## Install with the URBANopt installer

Follow the steps below or watch the [Windows Installer Video](https://urbanopt-tutorial.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/01_Windows_Installer.mp4).

1. Download the desired version of the [.exe installer](http://urbanopt-cli-installers.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

1. Use the GUI installer and choose a directory to install. Once installed, open a  terminal and run the provided setup script for that shell (below are the setup scripts for each respective shell environment).

**Note: GitBash is recommended**

If you are unfamiliar with git or GitBash, you can check out this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGutIN5t9Mo).

### GitBash

```terminal
/c/urbanopt-cli-X.X.X/setup-env.sh
```

### Powershell

```terminal
powershell -File C:\URBANopt-cli-X.X.X\setup-env.ps1 
```

### Windows Command Prompt

```terminal
c:\urbanopt-cli-X.X.X\setup-env.ps1
```

<span class="label label-red">Important Note</span> Each time you want to work on URBANopt and you open a new terminal to do so, you will need to run the `env_uo` script to configure your terminal session environment:

### GitBash

```terminal
. ~/.env_uo.sh
```

### Powershell

```terminal
. ~\.env_uo.ps1
```

### Windows Command Prompt

```terminal
%HOMEPATH%\.env_uo.bat
```

## Manual Install

Follow the steps below or watch the [Windows Manual Installation Video](https://urbanopt-tutorial.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/03_Windows_Manual_Install.mp4).

1. Install [Ruby 3.2.2 (x64) with DevKit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/tag/RubyInstaller-3.2.2-1)

    Make sure that you select option 3: **MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain** during the installation process:
    ![installer options](../doc_files/ruby_windows.png)

1. Include path to Ruby by adding the following to your environment variables path:

    `C:\Ruby27-x64\bin`
1. Create a new environment variable `HOME` and set the variable value to the following:

    `C:\Users\<user_name>`

    Detailed instructions for [creating environment variables](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/create-custom-environment-variables-in-windows/) can be found online.
1. Install Bundler version 2.4.10:

    ```terminal
    gem install bundler -v 2.4.10
    ```

1. Install [OpenStudio 3.9.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.9.0)

1. Create file `C:\ruby-3.2.2-1-x64-mingw32\lib\ruby\site_ruby\openstudio.rb` and edit it to contain the path to your installed OpenStudio (where X.X.X is the OpenStudio version installed):

    ```ruby
    require 'C:\openstudio-X.X.X\Ruby\openstudio.rb'
    ```

1. Verify your OpenStudio and Ruby configuration:

    ```terminal
    ruby -e "require 'openstudio'" -e "puts OpenStudio::Model::Model.new"
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```terminal
    OS:Version,
     {<long-uuid>},                         !- Handle
    3.9.0;                                  !- Version Identifier`
     ```

1. Install the URBANopt Command Line Interface (CLI). This should not take longer than a few minutes. Visit the [known issues](../developer_resources/known_issues.md) page if the installation stalls.

    ```terminal
    gem install urbanopt-cli
    ```

## URBANopt CLI Usage

1. View available CLI commands with:

    ```terminal
    uo --help
    ```

1. For detailed instructions, see the [Getting Started page](../getting_started/getting_started.md).

## URBANopt Python Dependencies

As of version 0.9.0, the URBANopt CLI has integrated 3 python workflows: OpenDSS, DES, and DISCO.  To install these python dependencies, a new URBANopt CLI command has been created.  The following command will install python and pip as well as the python packages urbanopt-ditto-reader, geojson-modelica-translator, and nrel-disco.

```terminal
uo install_python
```

The python installation path will be printed in the terminal once python is successfully installed; you may want to save this path for use in future troubleshooting.

## DES Installation

The URBANopt CLI includes District Energy System (DES) support.  This functionality is implemented in Python and Modelica and requires additional dependencies before use.

While the GeoJSON Modelica Translator will be installed automatically with the UO CLI `install_python` command, follow the [DES Installation Instructions](./des_installation.md) to install additional dependencies related to this workflow.
