# Linux Installation Instructions

As of version 0.3.1, an URBANopt<sup>&trade;</sup> installer (Ubuntu 18.04) is available to install the URBANopt CLI, Ruby 2.5.x, and OpenStudio SDK at the same time.  If you'd rather install the dependencies manually, view the [manual install](#manual-install) section below.

For CLI usage examples, see our [usage examples page](../usage/run_project.md)

## Install with the URBANopt Installer

1. Download the desired version of the [.deb package](http://urbanopt-cli-installers.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

1. This will install to ```/usr/local/``` directory.
e.g.:  ```/usr/local/urbanopt-cli-0.3.1/```

1. To run the UrbanOpt CLI, first run the ```setup-env.sh``` script that generates environmental variables and stores these in ```env_uo.sh``` in your home directory.

```bash
/usr/local/urbanopt-cli-X.X.X/setup-env.sh  
. ~/.env_uo.sh
```

1. When launching new shell terminals, run ```. ~/.env_uo.sh``` to setup the environment. 

## Manual Install

**_Linux installation has not been tested exhaustively. Please submit a bug report via the [Github issue page](https://github.com/urbanopt/urbanopt-cli/issues) if you run into installation errors_**

1. Install Ruby 2.5 (anything in the 2.5.x range will work).  We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) to manage and install [Ruby 2.5](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions)
    - Install rbenv on your system
    - Install your desired Ruby version
    - Do not forget the `rbenv init` step of rbenv installation
    - Once installed, you may check which versions of Ruby have been installed and which one is active with: `rbenv versions`
    - Set your current directory to use Ruby 2.5.x with: `rbenv local 2.5.x`
    - Full documentation for rbenv can be found at the [rbenv github site](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#command-reference)
 
1. Install Bundler version 2.1:

	```terminal
	gem install bundler -v 2.1
	```

1. Install [OpenStudio 3.0.1](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.0.1) \

	OpenStudio is designed to be used on Ubuntu 18.04. For other Ubuntu versions, see the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) page.

1. Add the `RUBYLIB` environment variable path pointing to OpenStudio Ruby location by pasting the following line into your `.bash_profile`, `.zshenv` or similar file: 

	```terminal
		export RUBYLIB=/usr/local/openstudio-X.X.X/Ruby
	```

	(where X.X.X is the OpenStudio version installed)

1. Install the URBANopt Command Line Interface (CLI):

    ```terminal
    gem install urbanopt-cli
    ```

## URBANopt CLI Usage

1. View available CLI commands with:

    ```terminal
    uo --help
    ```

1. For detailed instructions, see the [usage examples](../usage/run_project.md) page.

## OpenDSS and DiTTo Reader Set-up

As of version 0.4.0, the URBANopt CLI includes DiTTo/OpenDSS support.  Since this functionality is implemented in Python, a different set of dependencies must be installed in order to use it.  

If you'd like to use this functionality, follow the [OpenDSS installation](./ditto_reader.md) instructions.
